# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Compose Multiplatform support**: CMP architecture guide, API availability matrix, expect/actual patterns, resource system (Res.*), migration from Android-only
- **Platform-specifics guide**: Desktop (Window, Tray, MenuBar, Swing interop), iOS (UIKitView, lifecycle gotchas, binary size), Web/WASM (canvas limitations, no SEO)
- **Design-to-compose guide**: Figma/screenshot decomposition algorithm, property mapping tables, spacing ownership rules, modifier ordering, design token mapping
- **Production crash playbook**: 6 crash patterns with root cause + fix, defensive patterns (SafeShimmerItem, zero-size DrawScope guard, dedup keys), production state/performance rules
- **CMP source code receipts**: Actual API signatures from `compose-multiplatform-core` for Desktop, iOS, Web entry points and interop
- **Animation recipes**: Shimmer, staggered list entrance, swipe-to-dismiss, expandable card, pull-to-refresh, FAB morph, bottom sheet drag, parallax header, animated tabs
- **Animation decision tree**: Which API for which scenario, rendering phase performance guidance
- **Gesture-driven animations**: Swipe-to-dismiss with Animatable, AnchoredDraggable, transformable (pinch/zoom/rotate)
- **Design-to-animation translation**: Figma easing curves to Compose, M3 motion tokens, spring parameter intuition, Figma spring conversion formula
- **Predictive back gesture animation**: NavHost transitions, PredictiveBackHandler, M3 automatic support

### Changed
- Rebranded from "Jetpack Compose" to "Compose" to reflect multiplatform scope
- SKILL.md: Updated name, description, triggers for CMP; added design-to-code workflow step; new reference routing entries; CMP source tree
- README.md: Updated title, badges, coverage table, file structure
- Animation guide: Fixed broken shared element transition code, added 9 recipes, gesture patterns, choreography, production spring specs, new anti-patterns
- State management guide: Added `produceState`, `rememberUpdatedState`, sealed UiState pattern, production state rules, CMP state notes
- Lists/scrolling guide: Added production crash patterns, collision prefix keys, dedupIndex, ReportDrawnWhen, device-specific pagination
- View composition guide: Added 5-step decomposition methodology, Scaffold/screen patterns, composite previews, fixed CompositionLocal explanation, adaptive layouts
- Performance guide: Added zero-size guard, composition tracing, movableContentOf, compiler report flags, production rules, CMP performance notes

### Fixed
- Shared element transition code now uses correct `SharedTransitionLayout` + `SharedTransitionScope` API
- CompositionLocal explanation corrected: `staticCompositionLocalOf` invalidates entire subtree (not "for rarely changing values")
- Removed incorrect `accompanist-permissions` deprecation claim (via PR #1 by @Daiji256)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Styles API (experimental) reference guide — covers `Style {}`, `MutableStyleState`, `Modifier.styleable()`, composition, theme integration, and alpha06 gotchas

### Fixed
- Claude Code setup: replaced non-existent `claude skill add` CLI command with correct file-based `~/.claude/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` approach
- Codex CLI setup: removed non-existent `--instructions` flag, now uses `AGENTS.md` only
- Windsurf setup: updated from legacy `.windsurfrules` to current `.windsurf/rules/*.md` approach
- Swapped logo to MIT-licensed devicon SVG

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- 13 reference guides covering state management, view composition, modifiers, side effects, composition locals, lists/scrolling, navigation, animation, theming (Material3), performance, accessibility, deprecated patterns
- 5 source code files from `androidx/androidx` (runtime, UI, foundation, material3, navigation)
- SKILL.md with workflow, checklists, and two-layer approach (guidance + source receipts)
- Setup instructions for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Amazon Q Developer
